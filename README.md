# FTB-Interactions
FTB Reserves the rights on all config/script changes specific to this pack

This repo is in a playable gamestate. What that means is you can create a default profile in the twitch launcher and name it ftb-interactions. Rename the folder to ftb-interactions.sav and then sync this repo right into your instances folder, from there copy the manifest and other files from the ftb-interactions.sav folder into the ftb-interactions instance and you should have a playable development version of this repo. It contains all mods, scripts and configs which are updated immediately without waiting for a new official release.

It is highly recommended that you do NOT use this repo sync on a server or any game worlds you dont want to lose as anything not published as an actual release should be considered unstable.
