if you want to run a sever you'll need to install the current version of forge for your server (forge-14.23.5.2795)
copy all clientside configs and mods onto your server and then remove the following clientside mod from your server instance:

BetterAdvancements
Discord
DynamicLights
f6Fix
InventoryTweaks
ainMenuScale
Moustweaks
NoNvFlash
reauth
Tips
ToastControl
XaerosMinimap
XaerosWorldMap


Feel free to add any addition mods for maintaining your server. Our servers are compatible with Chunk Pregenerator Mod and if 
you elect to pregenerate your world the recommended dimensions are 100, 145, 146 and 147

If you have any questions ask in our discord or issue tracker.
